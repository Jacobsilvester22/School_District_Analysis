# School_District_Analysis
## Overview ##
Just recently we have been notified of academic dishonesty coming from ninth graders at Thomas High School. Although the evidence shows it came specifically from the math scores, Maria has asked for us to drop all of the ninth grader scores from Thomas High School so we can reconduct our original study and evaluate any changes in the overall data.

## Results ##
Overall we looked at multiple ways on how this changed our original analysis.
1. How is the district summary affected?
 - The district summary is affected because we will see differences in the total average scores and overall passing percentages.
2. How is the school summary affected?
 - Only Thomas High School will be affected as the changing of their scores will effect the school's total passing percentages and average overall scores.
3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
 - Once we dropped all of the ninth graders scores we saw a increase in our average reading scores by 0.05 points and a decrease in our maths scores by 0.1 points. This resulted in a decrease in overall passing by 0.3%. Average Math scores dropped 0.1 points bringing the percent passing down 0.2%. This in turn saw a decrease in 0.1% in overall passing percentages.
4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
- Since all of the ninth grade was dropped we will have a smaller sample size, as we will only be able to evaluate the 10th through 12th grade now.
* Scores by school spending
- 
* Scores by school size
